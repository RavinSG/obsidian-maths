# Dynamic Security Risk Evaluation via Hybrid Bayesian Risk Graph in Cyber-Physical Social Systems

# Abstract
The objective of this paper is to investigate associated risks in CPSS, and a hybrid Bayesian risk graph (HBRG) model is proposed to analyse the temporal attack activity patterns in dynamic cyber-physical social networks.

In the proposed approach, a [[Hidden Markov Models|Hidden Markov Model]] is introduced to model the dynamic influence of activities, which then be mapped into a Bayesian risks graph (BRG) model that can evaluate the risk propagation in a layered risk architecture.

# Background
Hundreds of millions of users that use social media are facing security threats, such as cybercrimes, identity stolen, device/social profile hacked, overconfidence.

Effective risk evaluation should be provided to help the social network platforms and users well understand the security situation they are facing, and accordingly, security and privacy protection solutions should be developed to help the users stay safe online

The social systems security are facing severe’ security challenges,
1. Most social systems are unable to secure the environment for users. These platforms are unable to provide a reliable system to identify duplicated or fraudulent accounts
2. Social network scamming is highly effective and lucrative. Only less than 20% of scams can be spotted by the professional users. The social networks provide unreliable “trustiness” for users, which may result in rampant scams spread rapidly
3. Cyber attackers/criminals can easily target specific victims through social networks. For example, the LinkedIn was a key recon tool for the cybercriminals who executed the Anthem data breach and its 80 million stolen records.

# Contributions
1. Develop a hybrid risk analysis model in cyber-physical social systems (CPSSs), in which a hidden Markov model ([[Hidden Markov Models|HMM]]) is introduced to *model the dynamic user activities* that can cause potential risks
2. A Bayesian risks graph ([[Bayesian Risks Graph|BRG]]) model is introduced in the top layer to analyse the potential risks that the activities can cause. The BRG model is able to classify the user activities into three levels (static, dynamic, and behaviour) and can dynamically evaluate the potential risks that caused by user activities
3. A node mapping scheme is proposed that can map the HMMs in the bottom layer to the Bayesian nodes in the BRG model
