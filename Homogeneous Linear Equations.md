# Homogeneous Linear Equations

A homogeneous system of linear equations is a linear system of equations in which there are no constant terms.
$$\begin{align*}
a_{11}x_1+ a_{12}x_{2}&+ \cdots + a_{1n}x_n&=0\\
a_{21}x_{1}+a_{22}x_{2}&+ \cdots + a_{2n}x_n&=0\\
&\vdots&\\
a_{m1}x_1+a_{m2}x_2&+ \cdots + a_{mn}x_{n}&=0
\end{align*}
$$
