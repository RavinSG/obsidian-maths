# Matrices

Matrices play a central role in [[linear algebra]]. They can be used to compactly represent systems of linear equations, but they also represent linear functions

>[!tip] Definition
>With $m,n \in \mathbb{N}$ a real-valued $(m, n)$ matrix $A$ is an $m.n$-tuple of elements $a_{ij} , i = 1, \dots , m, j = 1, \dots , n$, which is ordered according to a rectangular scheme consisting of m rows and n columns: 
>$$
>A = \begin{bmatrix}a_{11} & a_{12} & \dots  & a_{1n} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} & \dots  & a_{2n} \\ \vdots  & \vdots  &  & \vdots  \\ a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \dots  & a_{mn}\end{bmatrix} , a_{ij}\in \mathbb{R}
>$$
