# Graphical Models

Graphical models provide a natural tool for dealing with two problems that occur throughout applies mathematics and engineering; *uncertainty* and *complexity*

In particular they are playing an increasingly important role in the design and analysis of machine learning algorithms.

Fundamental to the idea of a graphical model is the notion of *modularity*. A complex system is built by combining simpler parts.

*Probability theory* provides the glue whereby the parts are combined, ensuring that the system as a whole is consistent, and providing ways to interface models to data.

*Graph theoretic* side of graphical models provides both an intuitively appealing interface by which humans can model highly-interacting sets of variables as well as a data structure that lends itself naturally to the design of efficient general-purpose algorithms.

Many of the *classical multivariate probabilistic systems* studied in fields such as statistics, systems engineering, information theory, pattern recognition and statistical mechanics are special cases of the general graphical model formalism.
Eg: mixture models, factor analysis, [[Hidden Markov Models]], Kalman filters and Ising models.
