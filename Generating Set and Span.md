# Generating Set and Span

>[!tip] Definition - Generating Set and Span
>Consider a vector space $V=(\mathcal{V},+,\dots)$ and set of vectors $\mathcal{A}={x_{1},\dots,x_{k}} \in \mathcal{V}$. If every vector $v \in \mathcal{V}$ can be expressed as a linear combination of $x_{1},\dots,x_{k}$, $\mathcal{A}$ is called a generation set of $V$. 
>The set of all linear combinations of vectors in $\mathcal{A}$ is called the *span* of $\mathcal{A}$. If $\mathcal{A}$ spans the vector space $V$, we write $V=span[\mathcal{A}]$ or $V=span[x_{1},\dots,x_k]$
