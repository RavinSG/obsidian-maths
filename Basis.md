# Basis 

[[Generating Set and Span]]

>[!tip] Definition - Basis
>Consider a vector space $V=(\mathcal{V},+,\cdot)$ and $\mathcal{A} \in \mathcal{V}$. A [[Generating Set and Span|generating set]] $\mathcal{A}$ of $V$ is called minimal if there exists no smaller set $\tilde{\mathcal{A}} \subsetneq \mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathcal{V}$ that spans $V$. Every linearly independent generating set of $V$ is minimal and is called a basis of $V$.
